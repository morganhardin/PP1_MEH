To use StatMapSecure via Streamlit, follow the instructions below.
  1) Download all the files from this GitHub repository.
  2) Once downloaded, type this command in the terminal: streamlit run '{path_to_Home.py}'
       For example: streamlit run '/Users/morganhardin/Documents/Spring/Programming/Final_Project/Home.py'
  3) This will cause the application to run in the browser.
  4) From here, you can explore StatMapSecure and run Netstat and Nmap with the click of a button.

Important Note:
  1) Make sure to run Netstat before Nmap. The IP addresses needed to be found and saved since they are used to find the ports.
